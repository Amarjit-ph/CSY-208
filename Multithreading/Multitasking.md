# Multithreading
A thread is a light-weight smallest part of a process that can run concurrently
with the other parts(other threads) of the same process.
Threads are independent because they all have separate path of execution 
that’s the reason if an exception occurs in one thread,
it doesn’t affect the execution of other threads. All threads of a process share the common memory.

<b>The process of executing multiple threads simultaneously is known as multithreading.</b>
